A group from the newly empowered Christians has now taken to enforce their cultural hegemony zealously; first they see the Jews as their obstacle, then nonbelievers. Hypatia has no interest in faith; she's concerned about the movement of celestial bodies and \"the brotherhood of all\". Although her former slave doesn't see it that way.","status_id":"1","age_min":17,"age_max":0,"product_image":"http:\/\/img.omdbapi.com\/?i=tt1186830&apikey=18deef75","country":"Spain","language":"English","actors":"Rachel Weisz, Max Minghella, Oscar Isaac, Ashraf Barhom","director":"Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar","writer":"Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar, Mateo Gil","awards":"11 wins & 14 nominations.","type":"1","imdb_id":"tt1186830","grade":"A-","remixes":null,"vendors":[{"vendor_id":"4","vendor_name":"Hulu Plus","vendor_logo":"\/public\/images\/vendor_badges\/hulu_plus.png","vendor_product_link":"http:\/\/www.hulu.com\/watch\/357327"},{"vendor_id":"5","vendor_name":"Amazon Video","vendor_logo":"\/public\/images\/vendor_badges\/AmazonButtonTrans.png","vendor_product_link":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Agora-Rachel-Weisz\/dp\/B0047VSW30"}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":14,"subject_name":"Ancient Egypt","type":1,"parent_id":17},{"subject_id":18,"subject_name":"Math","type":0,"parent_id":0}],"tmdb_id":null,"subject_id":null,"suggested_by":null,"submission_date":null,"movie_link":null,"ip_address":null,"submitted_by":null,"subject":null,"approved":null,"approved_date":null,"approved_by":null,"selected":false},{"title":"Akeelah and the Bee","length":112,"rating":"N\/A","release_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","release_year":"2006","subject_name":null,"product_id":"125","description":"Eleven year-old Akeelah Anderson's life is not easy: her father is dead, her mom ignores her, her brother runs with the local gangbangers.

Her principal asks her to seek coaching from an English professor named Dr. Larabee for the more prestigious regional bee. As the possibility of making it all the way to the Scripps National Spelling Bee looms, Akeelah could provide her community with someone to rally around and be proud of -- but only if she can overcome her insecurities and her distracting home life.

Bold and outspoken, he cuts an entirely new image for African Americans in sport with his proud public self confidence with his unapologetic belief that he is the greatest boxer of all time. To his credit, he sets out to prove that with his highly agile and forceful style soon making him a formidable boxer who soon claims the heavyweight championship. His personal life is no less noteworthy with his allegiance to the Nation of Islam, his friendship with the controversial Malcolm X and his abandonment of his slave name in favour of Muhammad Ali stirring up controversy. Yet, at the top of his game, both Ali's personal and professional lives face the ultimate test with the military draft rules are changed, making him eligible for military induction during the Vietnam War. Despite the fact that he could easily agree to a sweetheart deal that would have meant an easy tour of duty for himself, Ali refuses to submit on principle to cooperate in an unjust war for a racist nation that treated his people so poorly. The cost of that stand is high as he finds himself unable to legally box in his own country while his case is contested in court. What follows is a battle for a man who would sacrifice so much for what he believes in and a comeback that would cement his legend as one of the great sports figures of all time.","status_id":"1","age_min":0,"age_max":0,"product_image":"http:\/\/ecx.images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51tLMSqUT8L.jpg","country":"USA","language":"English, French","actors":"Will Smith, Jamie Foxx, Jon Voight, Mario Van Peebles","director":"Michael Mann","writer":"Gregory Allen Howard (story), Stephen J.

The film follows a group of German schoolboys, talked into enlisting at the beginning of World War 1 by their jingoistic teacher. The story is told entirely through the experiences of the young German recruits and highlights the tragedy of war through the eyes of individuals. As the boys witness death and mutilation all around them, any preconceptions about \"the enemy\" and the \"rights and wrongs\" of the conflict disappear, leaving them angry and bewildered. This is highlighted in the scene where Paul mortally wounds a French soldier and then weeps bitterly as he fights to save his life while trapped in a shell crater with the body. The film is not about heroism but about drudgery and futility and the gulf between the concept of war and the actuality.","status_id":"1","age_min":0,"age_max":0,"product_image":"https:\/\/lh5.ggpht.com\/bTAbnk_i6eAMiWNHe33thetjLQpi0-RwJGQM4oDa52ttC9qaUsUx3WkGwF4q12aNe3WZyg%3Dw300","country":"","language":"","actors":"","director":"","writer":"","awards":"","type":"1","imdb_id":"","grade":"A-","remixes":null,"vendors":[{"vendor_id":"5","vendor_name":"Amazon Video","vendor_logo":"\/public\/images\/vendor_badges\/AmazonButtonTrans.png","vendor_product_link":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Quiet-Western-Front-Louis-Wolheim\/dp\/B002EC0RFK"}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":26,"subject_name":"Europe","type":1,"parent_id":17}],"tmdb_id":null,"subject_id":null,"suggested_by":null,"submission_date":null,"movie_link":null,"ip_address":null,"submitted_by":null,"subject":null,"approved":null,"approved_date":null,"approved_by":null,"selected":false},{"title":"All the President's Men","length":138,"rating":"R","release_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","release_year":"1976","subject_name":null,"product_id":"231","description":"In the run-up to the 1972 elections, Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward covers what seems to be a minor break-in at the Democratic Party National headquarters.

Hungry, dirty and sick, the pale-skinned foreigners were struggling to stay alive; they were in desperate need of Native help. Massasoit faced problems of his own. His people had lately been decimated by unexplained sickness, leaving them vulnerable to the rival Narragansett to the west. The Wampanoag sachem calculated that a tactical alliance with the foreigners would provide a way to protect his people and hold his Native enemies at bay. He agreed to give the English the help they needed. A half-century later, as a brutal war flared between the English colonists and a confederation of New England Indians, the wisdom of Massasoit's diplomatic gamble seemed less clear. Five decades of English immigration, mistreatment, lethal epidemics, and widespread environmental degradation had brought the Indians and their way of life to the brink of disaster. Led by Metacom, Massasoit's son, the Wampanoag and their Native allies fought back against the English, nearly pushing them into the sea.","status_id":"1","age_min":8,"age_max":0,"product_image":"http:\/\/ecx.images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51J18W-cfDL.jpg","country":"","language":"","actors":"","director":"","writer":"","awards":"","type":"1","imdb_id":"","grade":"A-","remixes":null,"vendors":[{"vendor_id":"5","vendor_name":"Amazon Video","vendor_logo":"\/public\/images\/vendor_badges\/AmazonButtonTrans.png","vendor_product_link":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/After-the-Mayflower\/dp\/B002S1C0EI"},{"vendor_id":"9","vendor_name":"PBS","vendor_logo":"\/public\/images\/vendor_badges\/PBSButtonTrans.png","vendor_product_link":"http:\/\/www.pbs.org\/wgbh\/amex\/weshallremain\/"}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":1,"subject_name":"American History","type":0,"parent_id":0},{"subject_id":10,"subject_name":"Native Americans","type":1,"parent_id":1}],"tmdb_id":null,"subject_id":null,"suggested_by":null,"submission_date":null,"movie_link":null,"ip_address":null,"submitted_by":null,"subject":null,"approved":null,"approved_date":null,"approved_by":null,"selected":false},{"title":"American Promise","length":135,"rating":"N\/A","release_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","release_year":"2013","subject_name":null,"product_id":"128","description":"This intimate documentary follows the 12-year journey of two African-American families pursuing the promise of opportunity through the education of their sons.","status_id":"1","age_min":0,"age_max":0,"product_image":"http:\/\/img.omdbapi.com\/?i=tt2545088&apikey=18deef75","country":"USA","language":"English","actors":"N\/A","director":"Joe Brewster, Michele Stephenson","writer":"N\/A","awards":"5 wins & 2 nominations.","type":"1","imdb_id":"tt2545088","grade":"A-","remixes":null,"vendors":[{"vendor_id":"5","vendor_name":"Amazon Video","vendor_logo":"\/public\/images\/vendor_badges\/AmazonButtonTrans.png","vendor_product_link":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/American-Promise-Idris-Brewster\/dp\/B00MJF2TVC"}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":28,"subject_name":"Civil Rights","type":1,"parent_id":1}],"tmdb_id":null,"subject_id":null,"suggested_by":null,"submission_date":null,"movie_link":null,"ip_address":null,"submitted_by":null,"subject":null,"approved":null,"approved_date":null,"approved_by":null,"selected":false},{"title":"American Sniper","length":132,"rating":"R","release_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","release_year":"2014","subject_name":null,"product_id":"129","description":"Chris Kyle was nothing more than a Texan man who wanted to become a cowboy, but in his thirties he found out that maybe his life needed something different, something where he could express his real talent, something that could help America in its fight against terrorism.

Young adults Bonnie Parker, a waitress, and Clyde Barrow, a criminal just released from prison, are immediately attracted to what the other represents for their life when they meet by chance in West Dallas, Texas. Bonnie is fascinated with Clyde's criminal past, and his matter-of-factness and bravado in talking about it. Clyde sees in Bonnie someone sympatico to his goals in life. Although attracted to each other physically, a sexual relationship between the two has a few obstacles to happen. Regardless, they decide to join forces to embark on a life of crime, holding up whatever establishments, primarily banks, to make money and to have fun. They don't plan on hurting anyone physically or killing anyone despite wielding loaded guns. They amass a small gang of willing accomplices, including C.W. Moss, a mechanic to fix whatever cars they steal which is important especially for their getaways, and Buck Barrow, one of Clyde's older brothers. The only reluctant tag-along is Buck's nervous wife, Blanche Barrow, a preacher's daughter. The gang's life changes after the first fatal shot is fired. Following, their willingness to shoot to kill increases to protect themselves and their livelihood. Their notoriety precedes them, so much so that no matter what one's opinion is of them, most want to have some association to the Barrow gang, to help them, to be spoken in the same breath as them, or to capture and or kill them. Of the many people they encounter in their crime spree, the one who may have the most profound effect on their lives is Texas Ranger Frank Hamer, who is looking for a little retribution.","status_id":"1","age_min":0,"age_max":0,"product_image":"http:\/\/img.omdbapi.com\/?i=tt0061418&apikey=18deef75","country":"USA","language":"English","actors":"Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Michael J.

He immediately imposes a strict regime typified in written contracts that include stipulations for respectful behavior, a dress code and good grades as requisites to being allowed to participate.

However, when the overconfident team's behavior begins to stray and Carter learns that too many players are doing poorly in class, he takes immediate action. To the outrage of the team, the school and the community, Carter cancels all team activities and locks the court until the team shows acceptable academic improvement. In the ensuing debate, Carter fights to keep his methods, determined to show the boys that they need to rely on more than sports for their futures and eventually finds he has affected them more profoundly than he ever expected.","status_id":"1","age_min":13,"age_max":0,"product_image":"http:\/\/img.omdbapi.com\/?i=tt0393162&apikey=18deef75","country":"USA, Germany","language":"English","actors":"Samuel L.

Idealistic Erin Gruwell is just starting her first teaching job, that as freshman and sophomore English teacher at Woodrow Wilson High School, which, two years earlier, implemented a voluntary integration program. For many of the existing teachers, the integration has ruined the school, whose previously stellar academic standing has been replaced with many students who will be lucky to graduate or even be literate. Despite choosing the school on purpose because of its integration program, Erin is unprepared for the nature of her classroom, whose students live by generations of strict moral codes of protecting their own at all cost. Many are in gangs and almost all know somebody that has been killed by gang violence. The Latinos hate the Cambodians who hate the blacks and so on. The only person the students hate more is Ms. Gruwell. It isn't until Erin holds an unsanctioned discussion about a recent drive-by shooting death that she fully begins to understand what she's up against. And it isn't until she provides an assignment of writing a daily journal - which will be not graded, and will remain unread by her unless they so choose - that the students begin to open up to her. As Erin tries harder and harder to have resources provided to teach properly (which often results in her needing to pay for them herself through working second and third jobs), she seems to face greater resistance, especially from her colleagues, such as Margaret Campbell, her section head, who lives by regulations and sees such resources as a waste, and Brian Gelford, who will protect his \"priviledged\" position of teaching the senior honors classes at all cost. Erin also finds that her teaching job is placing a strain on her marriage to Scott Casey, a man who seems to have lost his own idealistic way in life.","status_id":"1","age_min":0,"age_max":0,"product_image":"http:\/\/img.omdbapi.com\/?i=tt0463998&apikey=18deef75","country":"Germany, USA","language":"English","actors":"Hilary Swank, Patrick Dempsey, Scott Glenn, Imelda Staunton","director":"Richard LaGravenese","writer":"Richard LaGravenese (screenplay), Freedom Writers (book), Erin Gruwell (book)","awards":"2 wins & 1 nomination.","type":"1","imdb_id":"tt0463998","grade":"A-","remixes":null,"vendors":[{"vendor_id":"5","vendor_name":"Amazon Video","vendor_logo":"\/public\/images\/vendor_badges\/AmazonButtonTrans.png","vendor_product_link":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Freedom-Writers-Will-Morales\/dp\/B000RHDZB2"}],"subjects":[{"subject_id":28,"subject_name":"Civil Rights","type":1,"parent_id":1}],"tmdb_id":null,"subject_id":null,"suggested_by":null,"submission_date":null,"movie_link":null,"ip_address":null,"submitted_by":null,"subject":null,"approved":null,"approved_date":null,"approved_by":null,"selected":false},{"title":"Get on the Bus","length":120,"rating":"R","release_date":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","release_year":"1996","subject_name":null,"product_id":"263","description":"Get on the Bus follows several Black men on a cross country bus trip to the Million Man March.

Pompeii is the incarnation of a civilization that was destroyed by this natural disaster. Some of its underground corridors were accidentally discovered in 1594 but serious scientific excavation did not begin until the 18th century. Even today, more than one third of the city remains concealed beneath volcanic rock. Because of the airtight conditions beneath the lava, Pompeii is the most well preserved ancient city in the world with perfectly preserved streets and buildings that provide detailed information of the former living conditions, trade, commerce and art of Roman times. The lively city attempted to compete with Rome and offered its visitors and guests abundant luxury and diverse entertainments and the interiors of the buildings with their magnificent reliefs indicate the wealth and high living standards of Pompeii's elite.

Four large platforms surround the Citadel, the administrative centre of the city. On the opposite side is the magnificent and impressive Quetzalcoatl Temple, which is adorned with several reliefs.

However, Mumble has an astute talent for something that none of the penguins had ever seen before: tap dancing. Though Mumble's mom, Norma Jean, thinks this little habit is cute, his dad, Memphis, says it \"just ain't penguin.\" Besides, they both know that, without a Heartsong, Mumble may never find true love. As fate would have it, his one friend, Gloria, happens to be the best singer around. Mumble and Gloria have a connection from the moment they hatch, but she struggles with his strange \"hippity- hoppity\" ways. Mumble is just too different--especially for Noah the Elder, the stern leader of Emperor Land, who ultimately casts him out of the community. Away from home for the first time, Mumble meets a posse of decidedly un-Emperor-like penguins--the Adelie Amigos. Led by Ramon, the Adelies instantly embrace Mumble's cool dance moves and invite him to party with them. In Adelie Land, Mumble seeks the counsel of Lovelace the Guru, a crazy-feathered Rockhopper penguin who will answer any of life's questions for the price of a pebble. Together with Lovelace and the Amigos, Mumble sets out across vast landscapes and, after some epic encounters, proves that by being true to yourself, you can make all the difference in the world.","status_id":"1","age_min":0,"age_max":0,"product_image":"http:\/\/img.omdbapi.com\/?i=tt0366548&apikey=18deef75","country":"Australia, USA","language":"English","actors":"Carlos Alazraqui, Lombardo Boyar, Jeffrey Garcia, Johnny A.

The city of Teotihuacan is no exception. The founding of this ancient and historically important city probably dates back to the second or third century A.D. when construction of the mighty Sun Pyramid crowned by a temple, was completed. The rain god, Tlaloc, and the Feathered Snake, Quetzalcoatl, were the major deities in the flourishing ancient city in some parts of which the magnificent decoration of various sanctuaries, including beautiful reliefs has been preserved to the present day. In Chichen Itza the association between the beautifully decorated ancient monuments and temples and their function as a place of human sacrifice is more than evident. Heavy stone tables and human-shaped sacrificial altars such as the Chac Mool create a rather disturbing and mysterious ambience and even today little is known of the true nature of the horrifying rituals that once took place there. Despite its rather modest size the magnificent location of Tulum, located in the northern part of the Yucatan Peninsula on the Caribbean coast, is still one of the most popular and well-known Maya sites in the world. Tulum was once entirely surrounded by a massive defensive wall with towers and battlements and in the 14th century the small port developed into one of the most important trading centres in the region. The desolate and extensive desert in Southern Peru hides one of the most spectacular secrets of Nazca culture, the legendary and mysterious geoglyphs engraved on the surface of the desert. There are illustrations of various animals that measure a hundred metres and further images that extend for several kilometres. The precision and huge dimensions of these lines is simply breathtaking. For some time it was believed that they could only be discerned from the sky but the truth is that they can be seen from the neighbouring hills.

Now, a team of architects and engineers is investigating the many mysteries of this icon of Western Civilization: How did the ancient Greeks design and build their masterpiece so quickly? How did they achieve such precision and perfection without modern tools and architectural aids that we take for granted today, such as comprehensive plans or drawings?

Her infant daughter, Mongo - such named since she has Down Syndrome - lives with Precious' grandmother. Precious lives with her mother Mary, who abuses Precious both physically and emotionally.

The wrecks of five ancient Roman ships were found in pristine condition, each one fully laden with exotic goods. Remarkably, much of the cargo remained exactly as the ancient Roman crews had loaded it, suggesting that these ships had not capsized but had gone to the bottom of the sea intact and upright. What happened to these ancient ships? What were they carrying and why had they traveled to this remote, rocky island in the first place? This summer (June 2010), the team is returning to Ventotene to investigate the wrecks, with the blessing of the Italian government. The island where this graveyard of ships was found holds significance in ancient Roman history: Emperors banished defiant women into exile there. But as this was essentially a royal prison, an extravagant palace was built on the island to house the captive women.

They also have differing viewpoints on the students themselves, and how best to praise and discipline them. The administration of the school tries to be as fair as possible, which includes having student representatives sit on the student evaluation committee. Marin's class this year of fourteen and fifteen year olds is no different than previous years, although the names and faces have changed. Marin tries to get through to his students, sometimes with success and sometimes resulting in utter failure. Even Marin has his breaking point, which may result in him doing things he would probably admit to himself are wrong.

O'Barry's view of cetaceans in captivity changed from that experience when as the last straw he saw that one of the dolphins playing Flipper - her name being Kathy - basically committed suicide in his arms because of the stress of being in captivity. Since that time, he has become one of the leading advocates against cetaceans in captivity and for the preservation of cetaceans in the wild. O'Barry and filmmaker 'Louie Psihoyos (I)' go about trying to expose one of what they see as the most cruel acts against wild dolphins in the world in Taiji, Japan, where dolphins are routinely corralled, either to be sold alive to aquariums and marine parks, or slaughtered for meat. The primary secluded cove where this activity is taking place is heavily guarded. O'Barry and Psihoyos are well known as enemies by the authorities in Taiji, the authorities who will use whatever tactic to expel the two from Japan forever. O'Barry, Psihoyos and their team covertly try to film as a document of conclusive evidence this cruel behavior. They employ among others Hollywood cameramen and deep sea free divers. They also highlight what is considered the dangerous consumption of dolphin meat (due to its high concentration of mercury) which is often sold not as dolphin meat, and the Japanese government's methodical buying off of poorer third world nations for their support of Japan's whaling industry, that support most specifically at the International Whaling Commission.","status_id":"1","age_min":13,"age_max":0,"product_image":"http:\/\/ecx.images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51ELd2G%2BpVL.jpg","country":"USA","language":"English, Japanese","actors":"Richard O'Barry, Louie Psihoyos, Hardy Jones, Michael Illiff","director":"Louie Psihoyos","writer":"Mark Monroe","awards":"Won 1 Oscar.
